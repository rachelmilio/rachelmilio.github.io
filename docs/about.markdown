The Attic Oratory Database is a project dedicated to showasing the corpus of Classical Athenian Oratory. The information presented on this site is drawn from the Attic Law Ontology, which is documented here and is available for download from Zenodo here.

This site catalogues the speeches of Attic Oratory, the events for which these speeches were written, and the people involved in these events and mentioned in these speeches. To navigate through the available texts, use the Corpus Index. To navigate through the legal events, use the Event Index. To navigate through the people, use the Person Index. 

The Attic Oratory Database was created by Rachel Milio as a part of the PhD thesis "Semantic Annotation and Attic Oratory". This PhD is being completed as a part of the TALOS Project at the University of Crete, supervised by Professor Christophe Roche and Dr. Maria Papadopoulou.
